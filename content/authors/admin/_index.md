Hello! A friendly and proactive individual with a drive to learn and explore fascinations in Science, thatâ€™s me. 

My name is Chakradhar and I hail from Bangalore in South India. I'm a Physics Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal. Growing up in a city close to nature and Science has sparked an everlasting amusement towards Science and its community. 

I specialize in Condensed Matter Physics and spend my time simulating Physics on Computers. Also, I keenly pursue Deep Learning as a hobby supplemented with coding, playing Cricket and learning Sanksrit. I am fueled by the ambition to promote Science Education and Open Science.
